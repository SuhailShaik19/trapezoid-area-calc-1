## Features
- **Divide a number by 2**  
  Useful for averaging the bases in the trapezoid area formula.
- **Multiply two numbers**  
  Used to multiply the average of the bases by the height.
- **Build up to trapezoid area calculation step-by-step using modular operations**

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript

## Purpose
To demonstrate modular arithmetic operations—division and multiplication—used in calculating the area of a trapezoid.  
This approach breaks down the logic clearly and enables unit testing of each part.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Checkout to branches for specific features (`feature/divisionByTwo`, `feature/multiplication`).
3. Run the calculator file in your environment (Node.js or browser).
4. Use the functions individually or combined to get the trapezoid area.
