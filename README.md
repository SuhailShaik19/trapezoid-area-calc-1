# Trapezoid Area Calculator - Addition & Division Features

## Description
This project calculates the area of a trapezoid using separate functions for addition and division.  
The addition function adds two numbers (a and b), and the division function divides a given number by two.  
Together, these functions help in computing the intermediate step `(a + b) / 2` of the trapezoid area formula.
