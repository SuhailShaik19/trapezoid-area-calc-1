# Trapezoid Area Calculator - Addition & Division Features

## Description
This project calculates the area of a trapezoid using separate functions for addition and division.  
The addition function adds two numbers (a and b), and the division function divides a given number by two.  
Together, these functions help in computing the intermediate step `(a + b) / 2` of the trapezoid area formula.

# Trapezoid Area Calculator - Division Feature

## Description
This branch focuses on the division part of the trapezoid area calculation.  
It provides a simple function to divide a number by 2, representing the `(a + b) / 2` step in the trapezoid area formula.

- Divide a given number by 2.
- Log the result of the division to the console.

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript

## Purpose
To implement and demonstrate the division operation used in trapezoid area calculation.  
This function forms part of the core logic used in computing the average of two values.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Checkout to the `feature/divisionByTwo` branch.
3. Open the file containing the `divideByTwo` function (e.g., `trapezoid.js`).
4. Run the file using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node trapezoid.js
5. Check the console for the output.
